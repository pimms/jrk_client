# JRK

Joakims Rikskringkasting


### Significant Features
- Live streaming from any* JRK-server
- Background play
- ï£¿watch companion app _(that mostly works pretty well)_

_*) there exists only one, and for copyright reasons I don't think anyone else
can use it. I'm not technically sure if **I** can use it._


### Building
_(Note that this might be out of date)_

- Install dependency pods throuch CocoaPods _(`pod install`)_
- Run the icon-generating script located at `scripts/gen-icons.sh`
- You should be good to go

Note that in order to actually do anything with the app, you need to point the app
to a JRK-server. See the [JRK Server Project](https://github.com/pimms/jrkserver).
